What is the nature of the Moon's uppermost surface materials?
How do the continuous erosion and weathering of the lunar surface by impact bombardment affect these materials?
To find out, we used the Air Force's Advanced Electro-Optomechanical System (AEOS) telescope
at Haleakala observatory on the summit of Maui, Hawai'i, to observe the Moon during a total lunar eclipse.
